# RespoNS
## What is it?
RespoNS is an organizational chart used to find colleagues and understand how a company is structured. One can use the website to search for colleagues, departments and even job titles, or simply click through the hierachy to gain a better understanding.

## Why the name?
RespoNS is a wordplay on the Dutch word for "response", a reaction I hoped to achieve by connecting my colleagues at [NS] (https://www.ns.nl/en). It has become the de facto organizational chart within the company since its introduction in 2017, with more than a thousand unique users each week.

## How does it work?
RespoNS provides an intuitive visualization of a given hierarchical dataset (CSV or JSON). The following controls are provided to the user to navigate through the hierachy:
- Move chart = Drag with left mouse button held down, or drag finger on touchscreen
- Zoom in/out = Scroll, or pinch with 2 fingers on touchscreen
- Center chart = Click on button "Reset view"
- Collapse/Expand node = Left mouse click, or press finger, on department node
- Open link to personal profile = Left mouse click, or press finger, on colleague node (defaulted to Google in this example)

To search for a colleague, department or job title simply open the searchbar in the top left. You can either scroll through the alphabetical list of departments and colleagues, or immediately start typing to search. By clicking on a result the chart is updated to focus on said department/colleague.

Each node had a unique URL which can be requested by selecting the "Request link" option in the menu that opens when clicking on said node with the right mouse button. In the same menu one can also request to be redirected to the manager of a specific colleague with the "Go to manager" option.
